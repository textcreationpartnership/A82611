            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To ſatisfie your Majeſties. Judgement and Conſcience in both theſe points, We deſire to make a cleare and free <hi>Declaration,</hi> of the Cauſes of our <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>jealouſies,</hi> which We offer to your Majeſtie in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the deſigne of Altering Religion, in this, and in your other Kingdomes, hath bin potently carryed on by thoſe in greateſt Authority about you, for divers yeares together; and that the Queens Agent at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes Agent at <hi>Nuncio</hi> here, are not only evidences of this deſigne, but have bin great Actors in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Warres with <hi>Scotland</hi> was procured to make way for this Intention, and chiefly incited and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Papiſts, and others Popiſhly affected, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have many evidences, eſpecially their free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Contribution to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> was framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived here in <hi>England;</hi> and that the Engliſh Papiſts ſhould have riſen about the ſame time, We have divers teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Advertiſements from <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it is a common ſpeech among the Rebells, wherewith concurre other Evidences and obſervations of the ſuſpitious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſultations; the tumultuary and ſeditious carriage of thoſe of that Religion, in divers parts of the Kingdome; about the breaking out of the Iriſh Rebellion; the Depoſition of <hi>O Conneli;</hi> the Information of Mr <hi>Cole</hi> Miniſter, the Better of <hi>Preſtram Whitcomb;</hi> the Depoſition of <hi>Thomas Crant;</hi> and many others, which we may produce doe all agree in this.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:132917-01:3"/>
            <p n="4">4. The publicke <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Lords, Gentlemen, and others of the <hi>Pale</hi> that they would joyne with the Robells, whom they call the Iriſh Army, or any other, to recover unto his Majeſty his Royall Prerogative wreſted from him by the <hi>Puritan</hi> Fuction in the Houſes of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and to maintaine the ſame againſt all others; as alſo to maintaine Epiſcopall juriſdiction, and thereof, theſe two being the Quarrells upon which his Majeſties late Army in the North ſhould have bin incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The great Cauſe we have to doubt, that the late deſigne, ſtyled The Queens pious Intention, was for the Alteration of Religion in this Kingdome: for ſucceſſe whereof the Hopes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and <hi>Count Roſetti</hi> injoyned Faſting and Praying to be obſerved every week, by the Engliſh Papiſts, which appeared to Us by one of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Letters directed by him to a Prieſt in Lancaſhire.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The boldnes of the Rebells in affirming <hi>They doe nothing but by Authority from the King;</hi> that they call themſelves the <hi>Queens Army;</hi> that the Prey or Booty which they take from the Engliſh, they marke with the Queens Marke. That their purpoſe was to come into <hi>England,</hi> after they had done in <hi>Ireland</hi> and ſundry other things of this kind proved by <hi>O Connelt,</hi> and divers others; eſpecially the aforementioned. Letter from <hi>Treſtram Whitecombe</hi> the Major of <hi>Kinſaile</hi> to his Brother <hi>Benjamin Whitecomb,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is this paſſage, that <hi>Many other ſpeeches they utter about Religion and our Court of</hi> England, <hi>which he dares not commit to paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The man old Attempts to provoke your Majeſties late Army, another Army of the Scots, and to raiſe a Faction in the City of <hi>London</hi> and other parts of the Kingdome; that thoſe who have bin Actors in this buſineſſe, have had their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:132917-01:4"/>Dependance, Countenance and Inconragement from the Court, witneſſe the Treaſon wherof Mr <hi>Germin</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand accuſed, who were tranſported beyond Sea by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under your Majeſties hand, after your Majeſty had given.

            </p>
            <p>The falſe and ſcandalous Accuſation againſt the Lord <hi>Kymbellon,</hi> and the Five <hi>Members</hi> of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, tendred to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by your Majeſties owne Command, endeavouring to be juſtified in the City by your own preſence and perſwaſion; and to be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon their Perſons, by your Majeſties demand of them in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> in ſo terrible and violent a manner, as farre exceeded all former breaches of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of <hi>Parliament,</hi> acted by your Majeſty, or any of your Predeceſſors: And whatſoever your own Intentions were, divers bloody and deſperate perſons, which attended your Majeſty, diſcovered their affections and reſolutions to have maſſacred and deſtroyed the <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Houſe;</hi> if the abſence of thoſe Perſons accuſed, had not by <hi>Gods</hi> providence ſtopt the giving of that Word which they expected, for the ſetting them upon that barbarous and bloody deſigne.</p>
            <p>The Liſting of ſo many Officers, Souldiers and others, putting them into pay, and under Command of Colonells, keeping them at <hi>White Hall,</hi> Feaſting and carouſing them in an unuſuall manner, thereby maintaining them in the violent Aſſaults, and other injuries, which they offered to divers of your Subjects, comming that way in a Lawfull
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:132917-01:4"/>and peaceable manner; the carrying them out of the Town, and keeping them in ſo long a Pay, after which they were told by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> that <hi>the King removed on purpoſe they might not be trampled in the durt;</hi> and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ingage the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court in the ſame courſe; the plotting and deſigning of a perpetuall Guard about your Majeſty; the labouring to infuſe into your Majeſties Subjects an evill opinion of the <hi>Parliament</hi> throughout the whole Kingdome, and other ſymptomes of a diſpoſition of rayſing Armes, and dividing your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by a Civill Warre, in which Combuſtion <hi>Ireland</hi> muſt needs be loſt, and this Realme miſerably waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, if not wholly ruined and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Lord</hi> Digby <hi>ſhould preſame to Councell your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to declare your ſelfe, and to retire to a place of ſtrength in this Kingdome, and to perſwade you that you could not be ſafe among your People, and yet ſhould have ſuch Credit with you as to be ſent may by your Warrant to Sir</hi> John Pennington, <hi>to land him beyond the Sea, where he took that tranſcendent boldneſſe to vent his owne Trayterous conceptions in the Letter to the Queene,</hi> offering to entertaine a correſpondencie with her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty by Cyphers, intimating ſome ſervice which he might doe in thoſe parts; for which he deſired your Majeſties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teations, whereby in all probability he intended the procureing of ſome Forreigne Forces to ſtrengthen your Majeſtie in that condition to which hee would have brought: which falſe and malicious Councell and advice, we have great cauſe to doubt, made too deep an impreſſion in your Majeſty, conſidering the courſe you are now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take, of abſenting your ſelfe from your Parliament, ang carrying the Prince with you, which ſeems to expreſſe a purpoſe in your Majeſty to keep your ſelf in a Readineſſe for the acting of it.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:132917-01:5"/>
            <p>The manifold Advertiſements, we have had from <hi>Rome, Venice, Paris,</hi> and other parts, that they ſtill expect that you have ſome great deſigne in hand, for the Altering of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the breaking neck of your Parliament; that you will yet find meanes to compoſe that deſigner that the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> hath ſollicited the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> to lend your Majeſty 4000. men a piece to helpe to maintain your Royalty againſt the Parliament; <hi>and this of foreigne force ſeemeth to be the moſt pernicious and malignant deſigne of all the reſt,</hi> becauſe no man can beleeve you will give up your people and your Kingdome to be ſpoiled by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if you did not likewiſe intend both to change your own profeſſion in Religion, and the publicke profeſſion of the Kingdome, that ſo you might ſtill be more aſſured of thoſe forreigne ſtates of the Popiſh Religion for your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſupoort and defence; but we hope <hi>God</hi> will direct your Majeſtie to better Councells.</p>

               <p>For my feares and doubts, I did not think they ſhould have beene thought ſo groundleſſe or triviall, while ſo many ſeditious Pamphlets and Sermons are looked upon, and ſo great Tumults are remembred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, uninquired into: I ſtill confeſſe my fears, and call God to witneſſe, That they are greater for the true Proteſtant Prefeſſion, My People and Laws, than for my own Right or ſafety, though I muſt tell you, I conceive that none of theſe are free form danger.</p>
               <p>What would you have? Have I violated your Lawes? Have I denve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſſe any one Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of my Subjects? I do not aske you what you have done for me.</p>
